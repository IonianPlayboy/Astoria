					The relationship between men and animals has evolved for thousands of years. In certain areas of the world, animals are complete social partners, and in others, you see them as part of the cultural beliefs and traditions. Prehistoric men started the taming process, multiplying interactions between men and animals. From there begins a segregation between the species: wild animals, livestock and pets. Some animals are also turned into divinities by some civilizations, they are used to represent the gods to whom they are related. For instance, in Ancient Egypt, Anubis who is the god of the afterlife is depicted as man with a canine head. In fact, animal representations are drawn into cultural and ritual practices since antiquity the world over. For about twenty years now, the animal welfare has seen a boost of interest and is now becoming a true societal challenge.

					Animals are in the middle of various cultural traditions around the world still alive today. Corrida or bull-fighting for instance is a duel in an arena between a man and a bull. It has been going for centuries in Spain, Portugal, the South of France and in many Latin American countries such as Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela. The bull’s foe, the torero, has to draw the animal towards him with his cape and manipulates the bull until he kills the animal at close range. This bout will assess the animal’s character: brave, slow, hot-headed… The corrida’s partisans see a southern tradition which needs to be respected as a cultural ritual. It represents the fight between men and the animal power, symbolized by a bull. In the daily paper El Pais, the tauromachy critic Antonio Lorca reckons that bullfighting is more a “dance” than a fight where both the man and the animal bravery is recognized. He writes:
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>“the bull is a way of understanding beauty, the audience observe the bravery, the brilliance, the stroke of genius, the harmonious triviality, the grandeur of an heroic artist and of mighty enigmatic animal”</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					By drawing the animal to him with his cape, the torero is looking to weaken the animal, wounding it until he finishes it. This fatality is made with all the due respect to the animal since there is a true traditional ritual preceding the final blow with a commune silence. Moreover, the animal cannot be killed if the torero has not risked his own life. The expected outcome being the death of the bull, anti-bullfighting protesters assert the animal sufferings. Bull-fighting has been prohibited in Chile, Argentina, Cuba, and Uruguay as well. Quoting the anti-corrida alliance from France, the practice renders violence common:
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>“Corrida is playing in the field of seduction with the bright colors, the shining clothing, the change of scene, the brass band. Everything is meant to eclipse the bloody reality”</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					The alliance puts forward the decrease in attendance of the bullfighting arenas. In 2015, it went down 15%, and 25% in 2016.

					In a few Asian countries, eating dogs is a traditional custom. It is thought that dog meat holds medicinal properties and can cure kidney and spleen diseases. Dogs are also seen as protective animals and thus, ingesting dog meat would allow to borrow its powers such as strength. For instance, in Korea, dog meat is considered a body temperature controller. In Southern China takes place the festival of canine meat in Yulin during the Summer solstice. The consumption of dog meat is a debated custom by Westerners. In a BBC news article, despite the controversy emanating from the international community, many people have answered that the Yulin festival should be considered as a tradition and therefore be respected as such. It is said that the consumption of dog meat during the festival period will bring good fortune and good health for the rest of the year.

					Animals still have an important position in many religious practices. Historically, rites giving as sacrifice an animal are known from antiquity. As of today, some religious holidays still call for an animal sacrifice. Judaism and Islam reckon all living creatures have souls. The blood symbolizes the soul that shall not be consumed. It would be sinful to eat both the soul and the body of the animal. Eating an animal is only allowed if the blood is shed in order to free its soul. Muslims distinguish two different types of sacrifice, <em>Ad-Dhakah</em> is the sacrifice meant for meat consumption and the sacrifice made during an adoration ceremony on the day of <em>Aïd el-Adha</em> for example. These sacrifices have to be made abiding strict rules such as the certification of the person doing the throat-cutting, the sharpness of the knife, the parts meant to be slit, namely the oesophagus and the trachea, the head of the animal has to be directed towards Mecca and most importantly, the act of sacrifice must be done by a Muslim. Jews use sacrificial slaughter as well, and this must be done by a shohet, a sacrificial executioner certified by the rabbinical intercommunity commission and the agriculture department. The sacrificial protocol must be followed to the letter or the meat would be rendered impure. In both cases, animal meat can only be consumed if the animal has been drained from all its blood. In some countries, animals are considered sacred and untouchable as per tradition. In India, cows are symbols of fertility. They foster procreation and boost the crops. It is forbidden to kill and eat cows. Crocodiles are totem animals in Burkina Faso. This comes from the legend of the town of Bazoulé which is said to have been founded by benevolent crocodiles. It saved a thirsty hunter who found a water source thanks to the reptiles. The festival of Koomlakré celebrate the crocodiles which are considered guardians of the village.

					Animals possess through popular beliefs symbolic properties and a cultural significance. They also feed the human curiosity with men looking to learn more about wildlife. The realization of the animal studies brought into creation the zoological parks.

					Previous to modern zoological parks were menageries. They used to belong to aristocrats and other noblemen and would gather different species of rare animals in the purpose of studying them or showing them to a public audience. In the end of the 18th century, there was a rise of the scientific interest in the animal kingdom. Menageries could not the possibility to observe and study animals as their condition of captivity was inappropriate. To respond to the need of studying animals, new infrastructures have been built. The transition from menageries, as private collections, to public institutions marked the launch of zoological parks. Opposite to the concept of entertainment conveyed by menageries, zoos are focused on observation and scientific study. We account for more than 10,000 zoos worldwide as of today. From Eric Domb, delegate manager of Pairi Daiza, a Belgian zoo whom explains that the number one goal of zoos is to preserve wildlife:
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>“A great number of species have been protected thanks to zoological parks, without them, they would have been extinct.”</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Actually, zoological parks’ main objective is to protect endangered species and wildlife in general. They especially maintain genetic diversity of the species through artificial insemination or assisted reproduction. They are also designed to be educational: better understanding of the fauna which surrounds us. Some species do not even have any living area left. In brief, the partisans of zoological parks stress the fact that zoos act as refuge for the species which no more natural habitat and may be endangered in the wild as elephants are due to poaching. For instance, the zoo of Beauval has succeeded in preserving rare species such as the Indian rhino, the okapi or the gorilla. They also started the world first semen bank for elephants.
					<br/>
					For those opposed to zoos, they see them as a prison for animals. According to them, an animal should not be caged but rather live in its natural habitat. They put forth the numerous cases of animal cruelty, and the living conditions not always fit for animals. They also criticize the fact that the public is not well informed and made aware of the fragility of the biodiversity. Costa Rica was the first country to close its zoos in 2013 and transformed them into botanical gardens and city parks. However, the newspaper Le Monde reveals that still in 2015 the government has not completed its objective since the Fundación Pro Zoológicos which manages the last two remaining zoos contests the turn.
					<br/>
					Many countries have now forbidden marine mammals shows. Since 1993, the United Kingdom has banned the captivity of sea mammals. In 2008, Chile forbade the capture and transport of cetaceans. In India, dolphins shows are illegal since 2013. Around thirty countries do not allow the presence of animals in circus shows, some of them being Costa Rica, India, Guatemala, Bolivia, along with European countries such as Belgium, Denmark or Greece. Other countries in Europe are anticipating in regards to circus since European laws do not guarantee the welfare of animals against any cruelty or abuse, may it be physical or psychological. In Japan, their will to protect wildlife is taken into consideration very seriously by preserving pure breeds. Thus, the Japanese macaque is kept off from cross-breeding. In fact, a Japanese zoo even euthanized around fifty apes which where born from the cross-breeding of Japanese macaques and rhesus macaques. The latter has been considered an alien invading species by Japanese law and therefore illegal.
					<br/>
					Taking into account animals into society depends on the customs and cultural practices of a country and its history. May they be feared, eaten or deified, animals have through ages kept an important role in the world of men.
