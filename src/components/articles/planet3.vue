						Robots programmed and developed by humans are subject to debate in many societies nowadays. Robots appeared in the early 70s and were originally created to perform repetitive tasks and / or those considered too difficult to be handled by human beings. They have evolved considerably since that time. Their status is questioned today, especially with the progress of artificial intelligence. Will robots remain forever a mere machines in the eye of humans, or could they be improved to the point to equal, or even exceed humans?
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>"Humans, limited by slow biological evolution, could not compete and would be left behind“</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						Hence opinions are shared amongst men, they are also shared amongst cultures. According to Karyn Poupee, author of the book <em>"Les Japonais"</em>, the Japanese society considers that robots have souls: this is related to historical, cultural and religious causes. The newspaper Le Monde also claims that robotics is deeply rooted in Japanese culture. In fact, Japanese have been passionate about what is manufactured or artificial for a long time. For them, robots are living things and made to serve. There is also an economic dynamic behind their obsession The Japanese population is aging and the labor force is becoming scarce (25% of Japanese people are over 65), but robots could remedy this. The late Stephen Hawking, a world-renowned astrophysicist, said in November 2017, at the Lisbon Web Summit, that AI could become <em>"the worst or best thing to ever happen to humanity"</em>. With AI, in the near future, it may be possible to repair some of the damage done by humans, be it environmental or economic.

						Sophia, the first humanoid robot to obtain Saudi citizenship in 2017, is an example of an impressive AI. She looks, thinks and speaks like a human. She knows how to recognize someone, maintain a conversation and learn, thanks to the famous <em>"deep learning"</em> system. It is a learning technique that allows an artificial intelligence to recognize the content of an image and to understand spoken language. The AI ​​is thus nurtured with images and develops its own visual recognition system from this process. Ben Goertzel, the creator of this humanoid also thinks that robots will one day become citizens like humans.
					</p>
					<p>
						On the Western side, opinions are more split: the French who for a long time saw robots as adversaries seem to consider them as an industrial opportunity that would allow them to do several things at once. Somehow this could be done only if man is at the center of the process. However unlike the Japanese, they do not think that robots have souls, and share little empathy for them. Brigitte Munier, the author of Robots: The myth of the Golem and the fear of machines explains that:
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>"The contemporary Western fear of intelligent machines threatening to rule humanity conceals an old and growing anxiety, that of no longer finding meaning in the nature and life of man".</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						This fear is especially fuelled by the myth that creation turns against its creator. For example, in 2014, 74% of French people thought robots "steal people's work". For his part, Stephen Hawking imagined a worrying scenario for the future of humanity. Indeed, he told the BBC in 2014 that with the progression of AI, humans would be quickly overwhelmed, because of their slow biological evolution. As a result, robots with full AI could end Humanity. Tesla boss Elon Musk is also concerned about this development. In response to the creation of the robot Sophia, he wondered for example what would happen if this robot was feeding intellectually, violent films like The Godfather. The same opponent signed with Stephen Hawking an open letter for the banning of "killer robots". These robots could fight targets without human intervention and mark the beginning of an AI-equipped weapon race.
					In the Anglo-Saxon countries there have been several media campaigns to ban sex robots which they say is an emotional disruptor. The "sexbots" would confirm women as an object in the view of  men. Meanwhile, in Japan, the Lovedolls, life-size dolls designed to serve as sexual objects, have been an integral part of the culture since the 1980s even though they are equipped with a rudimentary robotic system.
					</p>
					<p>
						Scientists all over the world aim to innovate through their scientific experiments, we have seen that robots are one of their concerns. However, they are also trying to innovate through animal experimentation.
					</p>
					<h2>{{'Medical research on animals: a necessity?'.toUpperCase()}}</h2>
					<img :src="assetPath('Universes', 'barre')" alt="Line">
					<p>In France, a decree imposes many methods of anaesthesia which must be applied in case of animal experiments <em>"to eliminate as far as possible the lasting damage, the pains, the sufferings or the anxiety”</em>. If animal usage in research is sometimes blamed in France, in other countries such as  Australia, scientists raise the fact that abiding by the rules is essential.
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>"Animal usage in research and teaching is subject to strict ethical guidelines all over the developed world."</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						They even go beyond, in 2017 they publish an article in Pharmacology Research & Perspectives, where they would consider alternatives.
					</p>
					<p>
						<em> "With the advancement of technology in medical research, we are now at a stage to consider manifold alternatives to using animals in research and teaching".</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						They then expose possibilities of research on organs, cells, human tissues, and other techniques still unknown. Many researchers see these alternatives as less effective, or even impossible. Australian scientists explain that this impossibility exists despite several ethical, political, and financial “incentives” to persevere in this direction. The extant alternatives serve to complement animal experimentation in current research.
						<br/>
						On January 25, 2018, the New York Times reported that Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW had forced monkeys to inhale car exhaust fumes. On 29 January 2018, the German newspaper Stuttgarter Zeitung states that humans were used as guinea pigs. The daily paper explains that this choice is not understood by the majority of the population:
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>"The idea of ​​proving the safety of exhaust gases by making them inhale by apes is already strange enough. The case becomes even more problematic when a group of manufacturers push the experiment to the point of having human guinea pigs inhale nitrogen dioxide, a toxic gas. "</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to meet human needs, xenograft experiments are underway. It is a graft transplant where the donor is of a biological species different from that of the recipient. Pork seems to be the best candidate at this level because its organs are similar in size to those of humans. Organ transplants from animals to men are still prone to failure: too much rejection, risks of virus transmission, ethical issues. Yet, according to Futurism, Chinese institutions are doing everything to obtain the necessary permissions for two reasons. First of all, the lack of organs in China means that more than 300 000 patients are waiting for a transplant each year. In France, 12 000 grafts are needed. Then, according to L’Express, Chinese researchers are also trying to have a scientific breakthrough before other countries. In the United States, researchers are trying to create mixed human and animal embryos called "chimeras". They hope to create animals carrying human organs to transplant them into sick men and women. Pablo Ross, a reproductive biologist at the University of California in Davis, explains:
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>"We do not try to create chimeras because we want to see a kind of monstrous creature, we do it for a biomedical purpose."</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						Stuart Newman, professor of cell biology and anatomy at New York Medical College, highlights some of the limitations of these experiments:
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>
							"If you had pigs with a partially human brain, you could get animals that would develop a consciousness, like humans"
						</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						Man is therefore divided between his habit of using experiments on animals, also for sociological, political and financial reasons and between turning to new alternatives which, when they require more time and more means while raising ethical issues. Technological progress plays therefore a strong point in our society, thanks to it we can imagine a future where experiments on animals would become a callback solution. But would this technological progress be equally effective?
